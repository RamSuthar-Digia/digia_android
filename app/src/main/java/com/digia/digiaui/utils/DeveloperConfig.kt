/// Sealed class representing different hosting environments for Digia UI.
///
/// [DigiaUIHost] defines the hosting configuration for the Digia UI system,
/// allowing different deployment scenarios and resource proxy configurations.
/// This abstraction enables support for various hosting environments while
/// maintaining consistent API access patterns.
///
/// The class supports resource proxy URLs for scenarios where assets need
/// to be served through a different endpoint than the main API.

/// Host configuration for Digia Dashboard deployment.
///
/// [DashboardHost] represents the standard Digia Studio dashboard hosting
/// environment. This is the most common deployment scenario where the
/// application connects to the official Digia Studio backend services.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```kotlin
/// val host = DashboardHost(
///   resourceProxyUrl = "https://cdn.example.com" // Optional
/// )
/// ```

/// Developer configuration for debugging and development features.
///
/// [DeveloperConfig] provides configuration options specifically designed
/// for development and debugging scenarios. This includes proxy settings,
/// logging configuration, inspection tools, and custom backend URLs.
///
/// Key features:
/// - **Proxy Support**: Route traffic through debugging proxies
/// - **Inspection Tools**: Network request monitoring and debugging
/// - **Custom Logging**: Configurable logging for development insights
/// - **Backend Override**: Use custom backend URLs for testing
/// - **Host Configuration**: Custom hosting environment settings
///
/// The configuration is typically only used in debug builds and should
/// not be included in production releases for security and performance reasons.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```kotlin
/// val developerConfig = DeveloperConfig(
///   proxyUrl = "192.168.1.100:8888", // Charles Proxy
///   inspector = MyCustomInspector(),
///   baseUrl = "https://dev-api.digia.tech/api/v1",
///   host = DashboardHost()
/// )
/// ```

    /// other network debugging proxies. The URL should include the port
    /// number (e.g., '192.168.1.100:8888').
